Improve and refactor the provided code so that it fulfills the tasks set before it correctly (worked as the euthor expected) and was of high quality (it was written with good programming practices and in the style of the Python language). Yoi can not use numpy or related (mathematical, self implementing matrix-like object) libraries.\n",
